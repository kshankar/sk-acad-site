abstract: "Cybercrimes are becoming a bigger menace to both people and corporations. It poses a serious challenge to the modern digital world. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, the global cost of cybercrime will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, which is significantly more than the annual damage caused by all-natural disasters and more profitable than the global trade in all major illegal narcotics put together. Botnets are the most common and have a significant negative impact on any civilization among malware programs. As a result, this study will explore various P2P botnet detection algorithms by outlining their essential characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, obstacles, and future research."
