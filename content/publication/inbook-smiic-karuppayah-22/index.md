abstract: "Semantic interoperability is one of the enormous challenges that need to be addressed to achieve the Internet of Things (IoT) vision. Accomplishing semantic interoperability in a heterogeneous IoT environment will allow a billion devices to exchange meaningful data in a form understandable by multiple devices. The paper presents the challenges faced by IoT due to the lack of semantic interoperability and the available method of achieving semantic interoperability in IoT. It also discusses the limitation of the current solution and recommendations on the future work needed."
